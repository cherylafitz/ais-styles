      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Generally, the goals of data protection and privacy laws around the world are to ensure that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Holders of protected information store and share it in secure, access-controlled environments. This information includes an individual's:
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>personal data,</li>
            <li>personally-identifiable information (&quot;PII&quot;), and</li>
            <li>health-related information;</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Holders of protected information use it only with the individual's explicit consent, which might allow for uses such as:
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>evaluating an exchange program application, or</li>
            <li>sharing a participant's grade transcript with a host institution.</li>
          </ol>
          It might <span class="text-highlight01">not</span> allow for uses such as:
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>contacting the participant for a donation, or</li>
            <li>sharing health-related information with a school; and</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
        <li>The individual has a right to access and have control over that data, such as the &quot;right to be forgotten.&quot;</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Organizations such as <span class="noBreak">American Councils</span> and its partners must follow these laws and regulations.</p>
      <p>Personal data and personally-identifiable information is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. This includes when you combine different pieces of information that, together, can identify a particular person, such as home address, age, and gender.</p>
      <p>Examples of personal data include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>name</li>
        <li>home address</li>
        <li>email address, such as name.surname@company.com</li>
        <li>AIS or other identification number</li>
        <li>location data, such as the location data function on a mobile phone</li>
        <li><span class="noBreak">Internet Protocol (IP)</span> address</li>
        <li>the manufacturer's advertising identifier of your phone</li>
        <li>data held by a hospital or doctor, which could be a symbol that uniquely identifies a person</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How You Can Protect Data and Ensure Privacy when Using AIS</h2>
      <h3>General Practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not share your AIS login(s) with anyone else. This includes not logging into AIS for someone else to use.</li>
        <li>Do not login to AIS while connected to an unsecured Wi-Fi or other network. You can resolve this by first connecting to a virtual private network (VPN).</li>
        <li>Always logout of AIS at the end of your workday.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>When Accessing or Displaying Data On-screen</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep your AIS web browser window hidden from view when others around you do not have authorization to see that data.</li>
        <li>Always logout of AIS when you walk away from your desk and when you have finished with your session.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>When You Download or Print Excel Spreadsheets, Documents Copies, Reports, or Other Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep the document hidden from view when others around you do not have authorization to see that data.</li>
        <li>Do not leave the document lying visible on your desk when you walk away.</li>
        <li>Store the document in a secure, limited-access manner, such as a network file space with restricted access or a locked drawer.</li>
        <li>Destroy the document when you have finished with it. With AIS, you can always download another copy, when needed.</li>
      </ul>
